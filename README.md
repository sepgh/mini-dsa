# Mini DSA
My minimal DSA notebook! Just holding some little information of some Data Structure and Algorithms that I learn because I tend to come back at them and try to find them again.


- [Big O](https://github.com/sepgh/mini-dsa/blob/main/big-o.md)
- Search algorithms:
  - [Linear search](https://github.com/sepgh/mini-dsa/blob/main/search/linear.md)
  - [Binary search](https://github.com/sepgh/mini-dsa/blob/main/search/linear.md)
- Sort algorithms:
  - [Bubble sort](https://github.com/sepgh/mini-dsa/blob/main/sort/bubble.md)
- Problems:
  - [Two crystal balls](https://github.com/sepgh/mini-dsa/blob/main/problem/2_crystal_balls.md)
