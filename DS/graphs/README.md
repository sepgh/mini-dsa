# Graphs

Terminology:

- Cycle: when you start at Node(x), follow the links and come back to Node(x)
- aCyclic: when a graph has no graphs
- Connected: when every node has a link to some other node or nodes
- Directed: when links between nodes have a direction
- Undirected: links have no direction and you can go both ways
- Weighted: the link has a weight
- Dag: directed acyclic graph

The term `Node` is usually called as `Vertex (V)` and `Edge (E)` is the connection between vertexes. So `O(V * E)` means for every vertex we will visit every edge.
