# Trie (Retrieval Tree)

Trie is basically a tree like a dictionary. The first node is empty, and the next nodes can be -for example- any of the 26 English characters. Once a path of nodes create a word we can mark the node with a flag, like `is_word = True`.

It's commonly used in word suggestions.
